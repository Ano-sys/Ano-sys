    Good you are here, lets talk about some extra information, after you've seen these shiny badges. My top languages are C, C++ and C#, these are the languages I feel home and pretty confident in. C# is distributed over some .NET Frameworks and lets call them UI Frameworks, I've built projects in .NET Framework and .NET in suiting combination with Avalonia, Wpf, WinForms, WinUi 3. I am also confident in writing Python, but Python is more of a language to get what I want fast but not consistent (no hardened App). I can also write HTML, JavaScript also in combination with Vue and Express, but also this is not my focus. For the main part my operation system needs to do what I want and not what it thinks is the best for me. So my choosings fell onto arch. MacOS is my daily driver for work that has to be done on the go (the M series chips just perform). I ditched Windows, because it's not built for me, it's build for the average user, pulling up word and surfing, playing some games. Windows blocks all interactions that seem to slightly be against their philosophie and thats not my way. Linux in general is an allrounder so my homeservers run on a mix of debian, ubuntu-server and of course docker. Thats it, have fun browsing my projects and eventually collaborating.
